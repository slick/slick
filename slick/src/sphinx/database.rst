Database Configuration
======================

You can tell Slick how to connect to the JDBC database of your choice by
creating a :api:`Database <slick.jdbc.JdbcBackend@Database:Database>` object,
which encapsulates the information. There are several
:api:`factory methods <slick.jdbc.JdbcBackend$DatabaseFactoryDef>`
on `slick.jdbc.JdbcBackend.Database` that you can use depending on what
connection data you have available.

Using Typesafe Config
---------------------

The prefered way to configure database connections is through `Typesafe Config`_ in your
``application.conf``, which is also used by Play_ and Akka_ for their configuration.

.. includecode:: resources/application.conf#mydb

Such a configuration can be loaded with `Database.forConfig` (see the
:api:`API documentation <slick.jdbc.JdbcBackend$DatabaseFactoryDef@forConfig(String,Config,Driver,ClassLoader):Database>`
of this method for details on the configuration parameters).

.. includecode:: code/Connection.scala#forConfig

.. index:: URL

Using a JDBC URL
----------------

You can pass a JDBC URL to
:api:`forURL <slick.jdbc.JdbcBackend$DatabaseFactoryDef@forURL(String,String,String,Properties,String,AsyncExecutor,Boolean,ClassLoader):DatabaseDef>`.
(see your database's JDBC driver's documentation for the correct URL syntax).

.. includecode:: code/Connection.scala#forURL

Here we are connecting to a new, empty, in-memory H2 database called ``test1`` and keep it resident
until the JVM ends (``DB_CLOSE_DELAY=-1``, which is H2 specific).

.. index:: DataSource

Using a Database URL
--------------------

A Database URL, a platform independent URL in the
form ``vendor://user:password@host:port/db``,
is often provided by platforms such as Heroku.
You can use a Database URL in Typesafe Config as shown here:

.. includecode:: resources/application.conf#dburl

By default, the data source will use the value of the ``DATABASE_URL`` environment variable.
Thus you may omit the ``url`` property if the ``DATABASE_URL`` environment variable
is set. You may also define a custom environment variable with standard
Typesafe Config syntax, such as ``${?MYSQL_DATABASE_URL}``.

Or you may pass a :api:`DatabaseUrlDataSource <slick/jdbc/DatabaseUrlDataSource>` object to
:api:`forDataSource <slick.jdbc.JdbcBackend$DatabaseFactoryDef@forDataSource(DataSource,AsyncExecutor,Boolean):DatabaseDef>`.

.. includecode:: code/Connection.scala#forDatabaseURL


Using a DataSource
------------------

You can pass a :javaapi:`DataSource <javax/sql/DataSource>` object to
:api:`forDataSource <slick.jdbc.JdbcBackend$DatabaseFactoryDef@forDataSource(DataSource,AsyncExecutor,Boolean):DatabaseDef>`.
If you got it from the connection pool of your application framework, this plugs the pool into Slick.

.. includecode:: code/Connection.scala#forDataSource

.. index:: JNDI

Using a JNDI Name
-----------------

If you are using :wikipedia:`JNDI` you can pass a JNDI name to
:api:`forName <slick.jdbc.JdbcBackend$DatabaseFactoryDef@forName(String,AsyncExecutor):DatabaseDef>`
under which a :javaapi:`DataSource <javax/sql/DataSource>` object can be looked up.

.. includecode:: code/Connection.scala#forName

.. index::
   pair: thread; pool

Database thread pool
--------------------

Every ``Database`` contains an :api:`slick.util.AsyncExecutor` that manages the thread pool
for asynchronous execution of Database I/O Actions. Its size is the main parameter to tune for the best
performance of the ``Database`` object. It should be set to the value that you would use for the
size of the *connection pool* in a traditional, blocking application (see `About Pool Sizing`_
in the HikariCP_ documentation for further information). When using
:api:`Database.forConfig <slick.jdbc.JdbcBackend$DatabaseFactoryDef@forConfig(String,Config,Driver,ClassLoader):Database>`,
the thread pool is configured directly in the external configuration file together with the connection
parameters. If you use any other factory method to get a ``Database``, you can either use a default
configuration or specify a custom AsyncExecutor:

.. includecode:: code/Connection.scala#forURL2

.. index::
   pair: connection; pool

Connection pools
----------------

When using a connection pool (which is always recommended in production environments) the *minimum*
size of the *connection pool* should also be set to at least the same size. The *maximum* size of
the *connection pool* can be set much higher than in a blocking application. Any connections beyond
the size of the *thread pool* will only be used when other connections are required to keep a
database session open (e.g. while waiting for the result from an asynchronous computation in the
middle of a transaction) but are not actively doing any work on the database.

Note that reasonable defaults for the connection pool sizes are calculated from the thread pool
size when using
:api:`Database.forConfig <slick.jdbc.JdbcBackend$DatabaseFactoryDef@forConfig(String,Config,Driver,ClassLoader):Database>`.

Slick uses *prepared* statements wherever possible but it does not cache them on its own. You
should therefore enable prepared statement caching in the connection pool's configuration.

DatabaseConfig
--------------

On top of the configuration syntax for ``Database``, there is another layer in the form of
:api:`slick.basic.DatabaseConfig` which allows you to configure a Slick profile plus a
matching ``Database`` together. This makes it easy to abstract over different kinds of
database systems by simply changing a configuration file.

Here is a typical ``DatabaseConfig`` with a Slick profile object in ``profile`` and the database
configuration in ``db``:

.. includecode:: resources/application.conf#tsql
