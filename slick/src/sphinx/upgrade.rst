Compatibility Policy
====================

Slick requires Scala 2.10 or 2.11. (For Scala 2.9 please use ScalaQuery_, the predecessor of Slick).

Slick version numbers consist of an epoch, a major and minor version, and possibly a qualifier
(for milestone, RC and SNAPSHOT versions).

For release versions (i.e. versions without a qualifier), backward binary compatibility is
guaranteed between releases with the same epoch and major version (e.g. you could use 2.1.2 as a
drop-in relacement for 2.1.0 but not for 2.0.0). :doc:`Slick Extensions <extensions>` requires at
least the same minor version of Slick (e.g. Slick Extensions 2.1.2 can be used with Slick 2.1.2 but
not with Slick 2.1.1). Binary compatibility is not preserved for `slick-codegen`, which is generally
used at compile-time.

We do not guarantee source compatibility but we try to preserve it within the same major release.
Upgrading to a new major release may require some changes to your sources. We generally deprecate
old features and keep them around for a full major release cycle (i.e. features which become
deprecated in 2.1.0 will not be removed before 2.2.0) but this is not possible for all kinds of
changes.

Release candidates have the same compatibility guarantees as the final versions to which they
lead. There are *no compatibility guarantees* whatsoever for milestones and snapshots.

Upgrade from 3.1 to 3.2
=======================

This section describes the changes that are needed when upgrading from Slick 3.1 to 3.2. If you are
currently using an older version of Slick, please see the older `Slick Manuals`_ for details on other
changes that may be required.
