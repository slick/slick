Database Migrations
===================
Slick itself does not have out-of-the-box support for database migrations,
but there are some third-party tools that work well with Slick. This page
provides a list of them.

Scala Forklift
--------------
[Scala Forklift](https://github.com/lastland/scala-forklift) is a
type-safe data migration tool with great support for Slick. Users can
define their database migrations using either type-safe Slick queries
or plain SQL queries. Scala Forklift will automatically apply the
unapplied user-defined database migrations in the right order, and
manage the Scala code corresponding to the database schemas using
the Slick code generator.

An example can be found
[here](https://github.com/lastland/scala-forklift/tree/develop/example).

An example of using Play, Slick, and Forklift can be found
[here](https://github.com/lastland/play-slick-forklift-example).

slick-migration-api
-------------------
[slick-migration-api](https://github.com/nafg/slick-migration-api) is a
library for defining database migrations, for use with Slick. It supports
altering database schemas using a type-safe Scala DSL.

Flyway
------

[Flyway](https://flywaydb.org/) is a database migration tool that can
run SQL or Java against a database.

[SBT integration](https://flywaydb.org/documentation/sbt/) is available,
and there is an example [Play project](https://github.com/playframework/play-isolated-slick#database-migration)
that shows Flyway in a module with Slick code generation.
